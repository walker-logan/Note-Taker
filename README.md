## Project Description

This application uses Express and JavaScript to allow users to store and manage notes. It uses a JSON file to save and retrieve data. My responsibilities included connecting the backend and frontend through GET, POST, and DELETE requests within Express. I used Insomnia to test routes and learned some basic functionality of Express. Future development would focus on organizing files.

Here, users can view existing notes and create new ones that will be saved to and persisted in the database.
